				<h2>Who is this broad?</h2>
					<img src="./img/heather.jpg">
					<p>
						Many would describe Heather as having the mentality of a 13-year-old boy. She enjoys many inappropriate jokes and has often shouted <span style="font-style:italic">TWSS</span> at inappropriate times. Although slightly offensive, Heather is sweet person. She is still working on being more patient; however, she will forever remain as stubborn as a mule.<br/>
						This bio is going to ramble on now to test our fixed nav div. I totally get iit if this I hear TL;DR!
					</p>

				<h2>And just what does she know?</h2>
					<p>
						Her education in printmaking allowed her to learn the nuances of various printing processes and provided her with a solid background in modern print production. The experience Heather gained as a lead graphics operator at Herff Jones demonstrateed her ability to work with others through the creative production process.
					</p>
					<p>
						At Slumpy's: the glass mold company, Heather was responsible for designing all in-house products and promotional materials including: e-mail campaigns, magazine ads, company collateral, product packaging, and any other in-house design needs. Her additional responsibilities included product photography, copy writing, & social media marketing.
					</p>
				<h2>What does Heather like?</h2>
					
					<p>
						<img src="./img/my guys.jpg">
						Well - now we're getting to what's really important! <br>
						I'm sure by now you've heard her mention (more than once) her corgi. Although she loves Pepperjack, he does not feal the same way about her as she does about him. Their daily ritual consists of him growling at her at least 4 times.
					</p>
					<p>
						What is Heather's top 10 favorite foods? (Maybe in an ordered list to push this down?)
						<ol>
							<li>Burritos</li>
							<li>Lamb Rogan Josh</li>
							<li>Pad Thai</li>
							<li>Strawberries</li>
							<li>Red Cabbage</li>
							<li>Broccoli</li>
							<li>Creme Brulee</li>
							<li>Bok Choy</li>
							<li>Carrots</li>
							<li>Spicy Curry</li>
						</ol>
					</p>
				<h2>Is Heather Done talking about herself?</h2>
					<p>
						Yes! I finally see that the fixed nav bar is working. Time to be hittin' the ol' dusty trail.... but I'll probably surf imgur for a bit.
